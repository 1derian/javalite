Open API Maven Plugin is designed to extract parts of an Open API  specification 
from Java source files and to generate a single YML or JSON file to be hosted 
on an external (not included with the plugin) UI tool, such as Swagger UI. 

For more information, refer to the [JavaLite Site](https://javalite.io).
