# Hornet Nest is an asynchronous processor for Java applications

This is a simple to use library for processing asynchronous jobs. It can be used in a web application to process
 jobs in a thread separate from the one that renders HTML. It is also a general purpose library that can be used in any
 non-web system.

Internal Implementation is based on [JBoss HornetQ](http://hornetq.jboss.org/).
